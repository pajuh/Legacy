Legacy is a small thing, which can create adapters automatically for you. 

Idea came from certain annoying situation when dealing with legacy code. 

Currently you can:

1) create adapter or proxy for one interface from one class.
2) create facade from set of classes to implement one interface
3) you can give your custom mapping for methods

See:

/src/test/java/com/houston/legacy/adapter/AdapterySpec.java

For usage
